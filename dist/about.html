          <p>
            My name is Curtis Wyman and if you are reading this you already know
            I like to program Android apps. In my spare time, if I'm not working
            on solving a problem, I am listening to an audiobook or trying to
            think of the next great thing. One of my favorite quotes is credited
            to Marcus Aurelius, it goes, "A man's worth is no greater than his
            ambitions". I find this to be a powerful statement and try to
            increase my worth on a daily basis.

          <h3>Firebase Authentication</h3>
          <h6>Firebase User Sign-in</h6>
          <p>
            I successfully utilized Firebase Authentication for my published
            appâ€™s email/password verification, storage and resets. This allows
            me to only let verified users into my app for database manipulation.
            It works very well in addition to the Firebase Realtime Database
            while giving end-to-end identity solutions for myself as the
            developer to use.

          <h3>Firebase Data Storage</h3>
          <h6>Firebase Realtime Database</h6>
          <p>
            I have successfully utilized Firebase Realtime Database to store my
            published app's data in a JSON style format and only allow
            read/write functionality to authenicated users as an added security
            measure. Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database with SDK
            support for iOS, Android, and the web. The benefits for using
            Firebase's Realtime Database is that data synchronization uses web
            sockets, allowing for very snappy transactions. Realtime Database
            also handles updates for you when a device is offline, syncing
            changes for you when the network reconnects.

          <h3>Android Dev</h3>
          <h6>Android Studio</h6>
          <p>
            I prefer working in the Android Studio IDE and utilizing the Java
            programming language. However, I do find an interest in Kotlin and
            have begun researching that language. I still enjoy Java more but as
            technology adapts I am definitely open to learning new languages and
            implementing them if it is more efficient for the project at hand.
